DVDocs uses an ant build scripts to build both the API and web service.  The 
package can be built by downloading or building several jar files that are not
available through maven, setting the CATALINA_HOME, JAVA_HOME environment 
variables and running the ant task 'ant build-deploy-all'.

1) Ant and a Java SDK are required.  Download and istall the latest version of 
   ant from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.  Java can be downloaded 
   from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.  

2) DVDocs uses maven to download most jar dependencies but there are several
   required jar files which aren't available via mavan.
               
   From the XSPARQL project the following files need to be placed
   in the digital-vitaDOCS/lib directory:
      cli-0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
      evaluator-0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
      osgi-consumer-0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
      rewriter-0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar
   These files can be obtained by downloading and building
   XSPARQL with the directions found at: http://xsparql.deri.org/download.
   Make sure you use version 0.3, at the time of this writing
   0.3 is the version found in the xsparql/trunk directory of the
   source.

   The Saxon XSLT and XQUERY library needs to be downloaded from
   http://www.saxonica.com/.  The free Saxon "Home Edition" can
   be used.  Rename the Saxon jar file to saxon.jar and place it
   the digital-vitaDOCS/lib directory. 

3) Set the CATALINA_HOME and JAVA_HOME environment variables to point to your 
   Tomcat installation directory and jdk install directory respectively.
   Examples: CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat or JAVA_HOME=C:\java\jdk-1.6_27.
   The CATALINA_HOME environment variable is only needed if you want to use 
   the ant build script to deploy this application to Tomcat.
    
4) To build and deploy the web service run the ant target build-deploy-all. 
   In the same directory as this file execute 'ant build-deploy-all'.
   
   This ant target will build both the API, resulting in dvdocs.jar, and the 
   web service, resulting in dvdocs.war.  The web service war file will then 
   be deployed to your tomcat/webapps directory.
   
   Other ant targets are available.  Execute 'ant help' to see the other 
   targets.
